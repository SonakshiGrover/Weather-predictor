# Weather-predictor
This is based on the client-observer pattern in Java

Weather predictor tool which in every 5 seconds, predicts the temperature of 3 cities: Delhi,Mumbai,Srinagar on the basis of the previous temperature values collected for the respective cities.
It also calculates the mean, median, max and min temperatures of each of the 3 cities.

The current temperatures of the cities are generated by the in-built random function.

bonus.java file contains my own implementation of the random function without using the in-built java random function.
